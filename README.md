# Yes-Bank-Stock-Close-Price-Prediction
# Overview
Through rigorous data analysis, it has been observed that some bad news/FUD heavily manipulated the market from 2018, which created a rug pull-like scenario as it was undetected by any indicator we have used in the project, although signs of retracement and capitulation could have been seen through detailed analysis from mid-2018 till 2020, it was a continuous downfall and not a healthy market movement.

Although the indicators did their work, we had seen that the moving average band acted as a support when it was below the price and acted as a resistance when it was above the price, same can be said about the RSI and Bollinger Bands both indicated LONG and SHORT opportunities for traders but MACD was not much of a help in this case as it was primarily green which could have trapped a lot of early investors who didn't book their profits on time and invested seeing the positive momentum of the stock and the same goes for ATR, few spikes were observed after 2017 but we have already concluded that it was a market manipulation, which could not be used for trading perspective.

From hypothesis testing we have concluded 3 major things

Market is heavily manipulated by the players involved, i.e., valuation of the company is not only determined by the fundamentals of that company, but the traders involved set the prices
One cannot rely on only bollinger bands for there trading strategy, as it can result in loss on there investments, if proper risk management is not done.
Yes bank's stock is very much volatile as we have tested and concluded that nearly 40 percent of the candles formed through inception is atleast covered by 50 percent of wicks in its respective range
The models I have used are

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Extreme Gradient Boosting

It can been concluded that among the models I have used Linear Regression is giving the best results, i.e. nearly 218 % growth in our portfolio with a threshold value of 1% over the last three years of the data set(testing data).
